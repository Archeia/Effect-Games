*Effect Games* provides a suite of developer tools for creating and publishing web-based video games.  The service is free for all developers, and includes an asset manager, level editor, sprite manager, environment editor, and publishing tools.

At the core of Effect Games is the *Effect Engine*, a JavaScript game engine which uses built-in browser technologies to render graphics.  Currently the engine uses pure [wikipedia:DHTML], but plans are in the works to support [wikipedia:Canvas_(HTML_element), Canvas], as well as the almighty [wikipedia:WebGL] in the future.  For audio and video we use [wikipedia:HTML 5] whenever we can, but fall back to existing browser extensions as necessary.  The Effect Engine supports all major browsers including Internet Explorer 6, 7 and 8, Firefox 3+, Safari 3+, Chrome 2+, Opera 9+, and all major platforms including Windows, Mac and Linux.

=section #.#. Background

The Effect Engine was developed by Joseph Huckaby in 2005.  He was dissatisfied with existing web game technologies that relied on 3rd party plugins, and set out to create a pure JavaScript game engine that would run in any browser.

A designer by training, Min Chang provides a necessary creative perspective to the development and use of Effect Game's tools.

=section #.#. Misc

This website is 100% pure [wikipedia:AJAX], the back end is written entirely in [wikipedia:Perl], and it does not use a database of any kind.  It was all made on a Mac.
