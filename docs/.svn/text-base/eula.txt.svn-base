=section #. Overview

By using the Effect Games Service (the "Service"), you ("You") accept and agree to be bound by the following End User License Agreement (the "EULA").

=section #.# Description of Service

The Effect Games Service consists of JavaScript code and web applications that allow You to build games, simulations or animations, and publish them to the Effect Games website, subject to the limitations and conditions described below.  These works are hosted on the Effect Games servers, but may be embedded on your own website as well.  You maintain complete ownership and/or copyright over your work at all times.  The Service is limited to allowing You to use the engine only, and does not provide You with the ability to access or modify the underlying engine code.

You acknowledge that you are responsible for the code, text, files, images, photos, videos, sounds, musical works, works of authorship, or any other materials that you submit, post or otherwise make available on the Effect Games website, and that you, and not Effect Games, have full responsibility for each such submission you make, including its legality, and trademark and copyright ownership.

Effect Games reserves the right to limit the number of games that you can create and/or publish, and limit the amount of data you can upload per game.

=section #.#. The Service is Provided “AS-IS”

Your access to and use of the Service is at your own risk. You understand and agree that the Service is provided to you on an “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE” basis. Without limiting the foregoing, EFFECT GAMES AND ITS PARTNERS DISCLAIM ANY WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT. We make no warranty and disclaim all responsibility and liability for the completeness, accuracy, availability, timeliness, security or reliability of the Service. Effect Games will not be responsible or liable for any harm to your computer system, loss of data, or other harm that results from your access to or use of the Service. You also agree that Effect Games has no responsibility or liability for the deletion of, or the failure to store or to transmit, any content and other communications maintained by the Service. We make no warranty that the Service will meet your requirements or be available on an uninterrupted, secure, or error-free basis. No advice or information, whether oral or written, obtained from Effect Games or through the Service, will create any warranty not expressly made herein.

=section #.#. General Use

Effect Games hereby grants you permission to access and use the Service as set forth in these Terms of Service, provided that:

=list
	You agree not to alter or modify any part of the Effect Games website or Effect Game Engine (including when embedded on another website).
	You agree not to use the Service for any commercial use, without the prior written authorization of Effect Games.  Prohibited commercial uses include sale of access to the website or its related services (such as an embedded game) on another website.
	If you embed a game on your website, you must not modify, build upon, or block any portion of the player in any way, including but not limited to the toolbar located under the main game display.
	You agree not to use or launch any automated system, including without limitation, "robots," "spiders," or "offline readers," that accesses the website or its related services in a manner that sends more request messages to the Effect Games servers in a given period of time than a human can reasonably produce in the same period by using a conventional on-line web browser. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Effect Games grants the operators of public search engines permission to use spiders to copy materials from the site for the sole purpose of and solely to the extent necessary for creating publicly available searchable indices of the materials, but not caches or archives of such materials.
	You agree not to collect or harvest any personally identifiable information, including account names, from the website, nor to use the communication systems provided by the website (e.g. comments, email) for any commercial solicitation purposes. You agree not to solicit, for commercial purposes, any users of the website with respect to their user submissions.
	In your use of the Service, you will comply with all applicable local, national, and international laws and regulations.
	Effect Games reserves the right to discontinue any aspect of the Effect Games website or service at any time.
	Effect Games reserves the right to revoke these exceptions either generally or in specific cases. 

=section #.#. Developer Account

In order to access some features of the website, you will have to create a Developer Account.  You may never use another's account without permission. When creating your account, you must provide accurate and complete information. You are solely responsible for the activity that occurs on your account, and you must keep your account password secure. You must notify Effect Games immediately of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account. Although Effect Games will not be liable for your losses caused by any unauthorized use of your account, you may be liable for the losses of Effect Games or others due to such unauthorized use.

=section #.#. Passwords

You are responsible for safeguarding the password that you use to access the Service and for any activities or actions under your password. We encourage you to use “strong” passwords (passwords that use a combination of upper and lower case letters, numbers and symbols) with your account.

=section #.#. Game Assets

"Game Assets" are defined as all the graphics, sounds, music, and text files that are used in your game.  These assets must be uploaded to the Effect Games servers in order to develop and publish a game using the Service.  This action does not constitute releasing any of your rights, copyrights or ownership of this work.

=section #.#. Source Code

You are free to minimize, optimize, or otherwise obfuscate your code prior to upload.  In fact, all three are highly recommended.  You may remove your Source Code from the Effect Games servers at any time.

You may not insert any code or product to manipulate the Service in any way that affects any user’s experience, reproduce, publish, broadcast, transmit, download, cache, distribute, perform, sell or in any way exploit the Service unless you are expressly authorized to do so in writing by Effect Games.

Effect Games does not endorse any User Submission or any opinion, recommendation, or advice expressed therein, and Effect Games expressly disclaims any and all liability in connection with User Submissions.
