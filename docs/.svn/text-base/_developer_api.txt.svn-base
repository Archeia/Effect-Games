=section #. Game Definition

The Game Definition describes your game to the engine, so that it can best suit your needs.  For example, you can list assets to be preloaded (graphics, sounds, etc.) so they are all ready to use when your game starts.  This is the first thing you want to setup for your game.  Here is a typical initialization routine:

=syntax js
	gGame.setHandler( "onInit", "mygame_setup" );
	
	function mygame_setup() {
		// initialize game
		gGame.setGameID( 'mygame' );
		gGame.setTargetFPS( 30 );
		gGame.setSkipFrames( true );
		gGame.preloadObjects( 'MyObject1', 'MyObject2' );
		
		var port = new Portal('d_game');
		port.setSize( 640, 480 );
		port.setZoomLevel( 1 );
		gGame.attach(port);

		// sprite plane
		var sprite_plane = new SpritePlane('sprites');
		sprite_plane.zIndex = 4;
		sprite_plane.setMinSpriteSize( 32 );
		port.attach(sprite_plane);
		
		gGame.load();
	}

=section #. Levels

A "level" is essentially a saved state of all components in the engine, from sprites to tiles, that can be restored into the visible portals at any time.  Whether your game has "levels" or not, the concept may still apply.  For example, your main title screen can in fact be a "level" -- the term is used loosely to define any saved state in the engine.
