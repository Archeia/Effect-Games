=section #.#. Sell Games

With a Pro Account, you can actually sell your games online.  You set the price, players pay online with a credit card, and you collect revenue.  You can choose to publish a demo of your game, and offer an in-game upgrade option for players to immediately pay and unlock the full version of the game.  You control which features are locked until the player decides to buy.  You can, of course, offer completely free games as well.

EffectGames.com offers a very competive shared revenue system, where you collect 75% of all your paid game sales.  We'll mail you a check monthly (direct deposit coming soon).

=section #.#. Microtransactions

[wikipedia:Microtransaction, Microtransactions] provide a way for you to sell in-game merchandise, such as special items, levels or features.  Players may buy individual items one at a time, usually for very small amounts of actual money.  Payments work by having the player purchase a pack of tokens, each worth $0.10 USD, using a credit card.  Then the tokens may be used to buy your in-game items (of which you set the price).

As with selling games, you receive 75% of all the microtransaction sales in your games.  This revenue gets added to your monthly checks.

=section #.#. Collect Ad Revenue

In addition to selling games, Pro Account holders can also collect revenue from [http://adwords.google.com Google AdWords] on your EffectArcade.com game pages.  Effect Games splits the ad revenue with you 50/50.  This revenue gets added to your monthly checks.

As a Pro Account holder you can, of course, opt to disable all advertising on your game pages.
