=section #. Overview

The Effect Asset Manager allows you to upload and manage all your game graphics, audio, fonts, and text files.  These must be uploaded because the Effect Engine performs real-time processing on the files, such as image transforms, image filters, audio conversion, and XML to JSON conversion.  Note that you do *not* have to upload any code until you are ready to publish a game release.  You can develop your game locally, keeping all your code on your Mac or PC.  However, if you want to edit your code online, you can do that too (see below).

=section #.#. Quota

Each game is given a quota of 100 MB, which includes assets and published game revisions.  If you need more than this, please [#Contact contact us].

=section #. Usage

=caption Screenshot of Asset Manager.

To use Asset Manager, create or open a game and click on the "Assets" tab.  On the left side you will see your folders and files, and on the right side a set of controls.  To perform actions on a file or folder, click it to select it, then choose an action from the controls on the right.  You can select multiple folders and/or files by holding Command (Ctrl for PC users), or Shift, while clicking.

The controls will change to match the selection.  For example, the "Rename..." option is only visible if you have a single file or folder selected.

=section #.#. Directories

When you start a new game project, several empty folders are created for you:

=filesystem
	audio/
		effects/
		music/
	fonts/
	images/
		backgrounds/
		sprites/
		tiles/
	src/
	text/
	video/

You can of course delete these folders and create your own file layout, if you want.  You can create any number of folders, by clicking on the "New Folder..." button.  Be sure to select the parent folder first by clicking on it.  If no parent folder is selected, the folder will be created at the root level.

Folder names may only contain alphanumeric characters, underscore and dash.  No spaces.

The "{src/}" and "{text/}" folder names are somewhat special, because you can |create new files| in them.  The "{src/}" folder is designed to hold your game's source code (if you prefer to develop it online), the "{text/}" folder is designed for XML data files.  If you select either of these folders, a "New File..." button appears in the toolbar for creating a new JS or XML file.  See [Creating New Files] below for more details.

=section #.#. Uploading Files

To upload files, first click on the folder where you want the files to end up, then click the "Upload Files..." button.  If no folder was selected, the files will be uploaded to the root folder.  You can select multiple files by holding Command (Ctrl for PC users) or Shift.

Filenames may only contain alphanumeric characters, period (.), dash (-) and underscore (_).  If you upload files that have illegal characters, they will be automatically stripped off.  Spaces are converted to underscores.

=section #.#. Viewing Files

To view a file, select it and click the "View" button, or just double-click it.  This opens a new window and points your browser directly at the file.

=section #.#. Editing Files

To edit an XML or JS file, select it and click the "Edit" button.  This will launch an inline editor, so you can make changes to the file without having to upload it again.

=section #.#. Renaming Files and Folders

To rename a file or folder, select it and click the "Rename..." button.  Enter your desired name and click the "Accept" button (or press Enter).

Note that if you have attached a file to a sprite or level resource list, renaming it will break this link.  You must remove and re-add the resource to the appropriate game objects.

=section #.#. Copying and Moving Files

To copy or move files to another folder, select them and click the "Copy/Move..." button.  This will popup a dialog where can select the target folder, and whether to move or copy the items:

=image /effect/images/docs/assetmgr/move.png style="border:0"
=caption Moving assets.

Note that if you have attached a file to a sprite or level resource list, moving it will break this link.  You must remove and re-add the resource to the appropriate game objects.

=section #.#. Transferring Files Between Games

To transfer assets between games, you must be a member of more than one game (either by creating multiple games, cloning a game, or joining existing games by accepting an invitiation).  Then, you can select any number of files and/or folders, and click the "Transfer to..." button.

=image /effect/images/docs/assetmgr/transfer.png style="border:0"
=caption Transferring assets.

If you select any folders to be transferred, *all* the sub-files and sub-folders go along with it.  Your assets will all retain their relative positions to their parent folders when transferred.  Meaning, if you transfer a file from the "{images/sprites/}" folder, it will be deposited into the "{images/sprites/}" folder in the target game.  If any folders do not exist, they are automatically created.  Existing files are overwritten.

Use this feature with care.  There is no undo!

=section #.#. Creating New Files

Typically files are uploaded into your game assets from your local Mac or PC, but you can also create new text files from scratch.  If you select either the "{src/}" or "{text/}" folders, you will see a new "New File..." button appear in the toolbar.  Click this to create a new, blank file which you can then edit online in your browser.

If you create a file in the "{src/}" folder, it will have a "{.js}" suffix.  These are source code files, where you can type in code for your game.  They are used in the "Quick Play" feature, and also included when you publish a release.

If you create a file in the "{text/}" folder, it will have an "{.xml}" suffix.  These are XML data files, which you can load and use in your game.

In either case, you can double-click on any XML or JS file (or click it once and then click the "Edit..." button), which will open up a full-window text editor.  Here you can manually edit the file contents, and click "Save" to save changes.

=section #.#. Downloading Files and Folders

To download a file, select it and click the "Download" button.  You can also download entire folders as ZIP files.

To download all your assets, deselect everything (a quick way to do this is click on the "Home" folder), and click "Download All".  This is a good way to keep a backup of all your game files.

=section #.#. Deleting Files and Folders

To delete files or folders, select them and click the "Delete" button.  Note that this is a *permanent* delete -- there is no way to recover deleted items.
